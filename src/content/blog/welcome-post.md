This post explains how to take raw text and turn it into a Markdown file that includes YAML frontmatter. It's useful for content management systems or static site generators that read metadata from files. We'll cover the basics.

## First Steps

You need a text editor. Then, you follow these steps:

1.  Start the file with three dashes (`---`).
2.  Add metadata using `key: value` pairs (like `title:` and `slug:`). Ensure lists (like `tags`) use the `-` prefix.
3.  End the metadata section with three more dashes (`---`).
4.  Write your normal **Markdown** content below the closing dashes!
